description: 'Creating scrapers and schedules with the Sonata API'
---

The Sonata API lets you create scrapers and schedules programmatically. Creating a scraper involved a reasonable amount of LLM usage, so takes a few minutes to compile. Once compiled, you can create a schedule to scrape data from a list of URLs and send the data to a webhook.

The Sonata API uses API keys for authentication.

## Creating an API key

To create an API key, go to `Settings` > `API`. You can create as many API keys as you want, and use this key to authenticate your API requests.

    border: '1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
}} />

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using the `sonata-api-key` header. To authenticate your requests, include the following header in your request:

```
Authorization: Bearer ${sonata-api-key}
```

Where `${sonata-api-key}` is your API key.
