This endpoint gets a scraper by ID. This is mostly useful to check the status of a scraper.

## Request structure

The request should be a GET request to `/scrapers/{scraper_id}` where `scraper_id` is the ID of the scraper you want to get.


## Response

The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `id` (string): The ID of the scraper.
- `title` (string): The title of the scraper.
- `status` (string): The status of the scraper, which is one of `compiling`, `ready`, `failed`, `healing`.

  "title": "Net-a-Porter scraper",
  "status": "compiling"
